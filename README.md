# Flight Performance

This is a `Julia` module that implements some of the formulas for
flight performance that I use during my post-graduate course in
Flight Mechanics.

Its a work in progress of course.

Following things can be calculated:

### Atmosphere model

- Density
- Pressure
- Temperature

### Aerodynamic coefficients


### Powerplant models


### Instrumentation

- True airspeed
- Calibrated airspeed
- Pressure altitude
- Density altitude
- Temperature altitude

### Aircraft properties

- Stall speed
- Construction of $C_L$ taking into account the Mach number, finite wing, Sweep angle $\Lambda$.
- Similar treatment for $C_D$
- Static stability Coefficient
   - Pitch coefficient
   - Yaw coefficient
   - Roll coefficient

### Altitudes

- Absolute ceiling
- Service ceiling

### Takeoff 

- Takeoff distance
- Takeoff speed
- Liftoff speed

### Cruise

- Maximum cruise speed
- Required thrust
- Range
   + Const. h - Const. v
   + Const. h - Const. v
- Endurance

### Landing

### Steady level turn

### Steady pull up

### Studies

-
